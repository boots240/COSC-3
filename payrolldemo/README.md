The PayrollDemo project comprises a sophisticated payroll management system with six classes, including exception classes for handling invalid inputs and a core Payroll class for managing employee information. The accompanying PayrollDemo program exemplifies the system's robustness by demonstrating the creation of payroll instances with both correct and intentionally incorrect data, showcasing effective error handling and providing a practical overview of payroll management functionality.
